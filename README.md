I have included several projects that I created this past semester in my object oriented class. In homework.java I create an array of numbers and manipulate the array in different ways.

AttackMonitor.java , MonitorDriver.java, and MonsterAttack.java are all part of the same project. In this prioject I create an object oriented application with several classes and a driver. I create a multi-class application to report on monster attacks.

Address.java, Course.java, Driver.java, FacultyMember.java, Person.java,Student.java are part of the same project. This project models a uiversity enrollment system and uses inheritance and composition as well as object oriented programming.

Demo.css , EtchGUI.java , Game.java, and Main.java are part of the same package. I created a java fx application that resembles a etch a sketch drawing device.
