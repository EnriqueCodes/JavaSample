# JavaSample

I have included several projects that I created this past semester in my object oriented class. 
In homework.java I create an array of numbers and manipulate the array in different ways.

AttackMonitor.java , MonitorDriver.java, and MonsterAttack.java go are all part of the same project. In this prioject I create an object oriented application with several classes and a driver. I create a multi-class application to report on monster attacks.
